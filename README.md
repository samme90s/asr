# Hermes

Hermes is an automatic speech recognition platform powered by an advanced LLM model
that seamlessly converts spoken language into text. Inspired by Hermes, the swift
messenger of the Greek gods, this project is designed to bridge the gap between
voice input and digital interaction. It provides a robust client integration for
efficient, low-latency speech-to-text processing.
